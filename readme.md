<h1> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python </h1>
<hr>
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

<h3>Key Concepts of OOP: </h3>
Class
Object
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Encapsulation
Abstraction
<br>
1. <h5>Class</h5>
A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

2. <h5> Object </h5>
An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object of that class is instantiated.

3. <h5> Inheritance </h5>
Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class can inherit the attributes and methods of another class. This helps to reuse code and establish a hierarchical relationship between classes.

4. <h5> Polymorphism </h5>
Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. It is the ability to redefine methods for derived classes.

5. <h5> Encapsulation </h5>
Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data.

6. <h5> Abstraction </h5>
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It helps to reduce programming complexity and effort.
